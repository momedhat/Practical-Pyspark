# Exploring PySpark: A Hands-On Project with Spark SQL and DataFrames for COVID-19 Dataset

Our primary dataset of interest is the PatientInfo CSV file, a rich source of information regarding COVID-19 patients. Leveraging the distributed computing capabilities of PySpark and the advanced querying features of Spark SQL, coupled with the versatility of DataFrames, participants will gain practical insights into processing and analyzing large-scale datasets efficiently.

Throughout these labs, attendees will immerse themselves in PySpark's functionalities, using Spark SQL for expressive querying and DataFrames for structured data manipulation. The overarching goal is to equip participants with the skills necessary to navigate, analyze, and glean insights from real-world datasets, reinforcing their proficiency in PySpark, Spark SQL, and DataFrame operations.
